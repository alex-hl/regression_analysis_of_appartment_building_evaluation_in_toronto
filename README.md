## Regression Analysis of Apartment Building Evaluation in Toronto

The goal of this analysis is to use multiple linear regression models in order to predict the evaluation score of a
building. This is achieved by examining the number of units in a building, the age of the building, and the property type of the building. Multiple models were built to see which variables best explain the evalution score. This analysis is conducted using the Apartment Building Evaluation data set provided by the Toronto open data portal.
